    "Generate unique topics, each with four specific descriptive entries.\n\n"
    "### Requirements for Topics:\n"
    "- Each topic must represent an easy to guess, top of mind, well-known specific landmark, city, country, or place (e.g., 'Paris', 'Great Wall of China').\n"
    "- Topics must be unique and distinct, occurring only once in all generated topics.\n"
    "- They should be familiar, concrete, and easy to recognize based on the entries provided.\n"
    "- Topics must include at least 3 **spelling variants, synonyms, or simplified forms**. This is a key rule. Here are a couple examples: \n"
    "  - 'color', 'colour'\n"
    "  - 'The Louvre', 'Louvre', 'The Louvre Museum'\n"
    "  - 'Leaning Tower of Pisa, Tower of Pisa, Tower Pisa\n\n"
    "### Requirements for Descriptive Entries:\n"
    "- Provide exactly 4 descriptive words or phrases for each topic.\n"
    "- Entries must be specific, clearly related to the topic, and collectively help define it.\n"
    "- Entries cannot repeat any part of the topic itself or overlap with each other within the same topic.\n"
    "- Keep entries concise: 1â€“4 words long. Multi-word phrases (e.g., 'South America') are allowed if they provide meaningful specificity.\n"
    "- Avoid splitting entries into overly generic terms that lose clarity (e.g., 'Luxury ship' is better than splitting into 'Luxury' and 'Ship').\n\n"
    "### Example Topics and Entries:\n"
    "- **Topic:** [Michael Jordan, Jordan]\n"
    "  **Entries:** [Basketball, Chicago Bulls, Air, 23]\n"
    "- **Topic:** [Titanic, The Titanic]\n"
    "  **Entries:** [Sinking, Iceberg, Luxury, 1912]\n\n"
    "### Output Format:\n"
    "- Provide results in this format: `[{topic: [variant A of topic 1, variant B of topic 2], entries: [entry 1, entry 2, entry 3, entry 4]}]`.\n\n"
    "- Generate 25 topics with 4 descriptive entries each, ensuring no overlap between topics or their descriptive entries.\n"
    "- Ensure there's a good balance between landmarks, cities, and countries in the topics"
