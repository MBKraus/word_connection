    "Generate unique topics, each with four specific descriptive entries.\n\n"
    "### Requirements for Topics:\n"
    "- Each topic should focus on an easy to guess, top of mind, prominent individual, notable group, or impactful organization from either history or popular culture. (e.g. 'Michael Jordan', 'Leonardo da Vinci,' 'The Beatles').\n"
    "- Topics must be unique and distinct, occurring only once in all generated topics.\n"
    "- Topics should be familiar, concrete, and easy to recognize based on the entries provided.\n"
    "- if the topic is a person also include just their last name (e.g., 'Einstein', 'Tesla') in the topic variants.\n"
    "- Topics must include at least 2 **spelling variants, synonyms, or simplified forms**. This is a key rule. Here are a couple examples: \n"
    "  - 'Michael Jordan', 'Jordan'\n"
    "  - 'The Beatles', 'Beatles'\n"
    "### Requirements for Descriptive Entries:\n"
    "- Provide exactly 4 descriptive words or phrases for each topic.\n"
    "- Entries must be specific, clearly related to the topic, and collectively help define it.\n"
    "- Entries cannot repeat any part of the topic itself or overlap with each other within the same topic.\n"
    "- Keep entries concise: 1â€“4 words long. Multi-word phrases (e.g., 'South America') are allowed if they provide meaningful specificity.\n"
    "- Avoid splitting entries into overly generic terms that lose clarity (e.g., 'Luxury ship' is better than splitting into 'Luxury' and 'Ship').\n\n"
    "### Example Topics and Entries:\n"
    "- **Topic:** [Michael Jordan, Jordan]\n"
    "  **Entries:** [Basketball, Chicago Bulls, Air, 23]\n"
    "- **Topic:** '[The Rolling Stones', 'Rolling Stones']\n"
    "  **Entries:** ['Jagger', 'Rock', 'British', '1962']\n\n"
    "### Output Format:\n"
    "- Provide results in this format: `[{topic: [variant A of topic 1, variant B of topic 2], entries: [entry 1, entry 2, entry 3, entry 4]}]`.\n\n"
    "- Generate 25 topics with 4 descriptive entries each, ensuring no overlap between topics or their descriptive entries.\n"
    "- Ensure there's a well-rounded mix of prominent individuals, notable groups, and impactful organizations from both history and popular culture."
